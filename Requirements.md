# Interview Task 2

# Submission Deadline: 20th DECEMBER 2023

Your task is to build a simple stateless microservice in Nodejs, with two major functionalities -

- Authentication
- JSON patching

And a dashboard to display the process and data.

### Required Endpoints

The API should feature the following endpoint functionality -

#### Public Endpoints

- Login
Request body should contain an arbitrary username/password pair
Treat it as a mock authentication service and accept any username/password.
Return a signed Json Web Token(JWT, <https://jwt.io/>) which can be used to validate future requests.

#### Protected Endpoints

The following two endpoints should be protected. The JWT obtained in the “Login” endpoint must be attached to each request header.  If the JWT is missing or invalid, these endpoints should reject the request with the appropriate message to the user.

- Apply Json Patch
Request body should contain a JSON object and a JSON patch object (<https://jsonpatch.com/>).
Apply the json patch to the json object, and return the resulting json object.

### Requirements

#### Backend Code Requirements

- Include a test suite for the microservice.
- We recommend using Mocha (<https://mochajs.org/>).
- API should reject invalid request inputs.  Test the edge cases!
- Use modern javascript ES6 syntax.

#### Other Requirements

- Use Git for version control, and host the project in a Github repository.
- Project should contain documentation with setup and usage instructions.
- Project should install all dependencies with “npm install”, should start the server with “npm start”, and should run the test suite with “npm test”.
- Really, please just don’t use “console.log” as the primary debugging/logging tool.
- Javascript Style and Linting
- Use a javascript linter, along with a linting npm script. We like clean code.
- Dockerize
- Include a working Dockerfile with the app directory.
- Push a docker image to public DockerHub, and share the link

#### Bonus Points

- 100% code coverage in test suite.
- We recommend using Istanbul (<https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul>) to generate code test coverage reports.
- Extra Documentation
- Include JSdoc comments and/or Swagger specifications to impress us.
- Logging / Monitoring
- Integrate a centralized app logging/monitoring system.
